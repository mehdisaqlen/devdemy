            <p>
              React is an extremely useful programming language for
              cybersecurity professionals because it can act as multitasking
              cybersecurity functions, including malware analysis, scanning, and
              penetration testing tasks.

          <p>Learn the basics of Ethical Hacking with Kali Linux.</p>
          <p>
            The goal of this course is to help you learn the basic fundamentals
            of hacking and to give you an introduction to becoming an ethical
            hacker. This course targets students who have little or no
            experience in hacking or penetration testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this course you will not only learn the theory behind hacking but
            you will also learn the practical side of ethical hacking. You will
            learn how to set up your own virtual lab environment just like the
            one used in this course. You will be able to follow the step you see
            in the lecture and replicate them in your own lab in environment.
            This course also has PDFs for each of the lectures to help you
            follow along.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also the software you will need for this course is free. If you are
            looking to get a good foundation in ethical hacking with Kali Linux
